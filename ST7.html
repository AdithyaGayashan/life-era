        <p>Eliminate poaching and trafficking of protected species Rhinos have now been poached to the brink of extinction. There are currently less than 70 Javan rhinos in the wild. You've participated in the wildlife trade if you've bought anything from
            seafood to coffee to bedding. Much of it is legal and regulated, but there is a dark side to it, and there are some things you can do to avoid facilitating illegal wildlife trade.</p>
        <div class="list2">
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Investigate before you buy.</li>
                    <p>Simply inquire about the origins of items such as jewelry or clothing. Inquire with the vendor about its composition, origin, and whether it is legal to sell in its country of origin.
                    </p>
                    <li>Use only certified products.</li>
                    <p>Products you might not think of, such as furniture and paper, can also contribute to hazardous wildlife practices. Products bearing the Forest Stewardship Council seal guarantee several things: that all trees cut down are replaced
                        or allowed to re-grow naturally, that parts of the forest of origin are left untouched, that indigenous peoples' rights in the area are respected, and that local workers are paid a living wage.</p>
                    <li>Select pets that are environmentally friendly and long-lasting.</li>
                    <p>
                        The EcoHealth Alliance maintains a database of pets that are good for people, animals, and the environment. Many animals are taken from their natural habitats and sold in pet stores in large numbers. This can be harmful to the animals' wild populations
                        as well as extremely traumatic for the animals themselves.
                    </p>
                    <li>Consume only sustainable seafood.</li>
                    <p>
                        Many fish species are on the verge of extinction as a result of overfishing. While some of these species are now protected, many others are still legally fished and sold.
                    </p>
                    <li> Write a letter to your local government requesting that the legal ivory trade be halted or restricted.</li>
                    <li>Express your support</li>
                    <p>There is power in numbers. Join organizations that are urging governments to do more to combat wildlife crime in their respective countries.</p>
                    <li>Inform the authorities about any illegal wildlife trade.</li>
                    <p>The internet has made the world smaller, and it is now easier than ever to report illegal wildlife trade when you see it. Wildleaks, founded by the Elephant Action League, allows anyone to anonymously report wildlife crimes anywhere
                        in the world.</p>

            End deforestation and restore degraded forests Preventing deforestation is our best chance at stabilizing our climate, saving wildlife species, and protecting our well-being. Protecting the forest is our shared responsibility, regardless of how far we
            live from the nearest one. Adopt some of these strategies to help prevent further tree loss.
