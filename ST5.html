                <span class="tab"></span> This target has one indicator: Indicator 15.5.1 is the "Red List Index".<br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="tab"></span>The Red List Index (RLI) shows trends in overall extinction risk for species and is used by governments to track their progress towards targets for reducing biodiversity loss. If the RLI value is 1.0, it means
                that species are categorized as 'Least Concern'. They will be expected to go extinct in the near future. If the RLI value is 0, this means that the species have gone extinct.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="tab"></span>Habitat loss, unsustainable hunting, the introduction of invasive species and other factors have led to the extinction of 322 terrestrial vertebrate since 1500. At the same time, the numbers of most living species
                have declined. According to a detailed assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 24,307 species are now seriously threatened with extinction.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="tab"></span>A report in 2020 stated that globally, the species extinction risk has worsened by about 10 per cent over the past three decades. The Red List Index is declining, from 0.82 in 1990 to 0.75 in 2015 to 0.73 in 2020.<br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="tab"></span>A report in 2018 stated that "biodiversity must be mainstreamed across these sectors and spatial planning integrated accordingly. It also tackles the importance of taking care of land degradation and restoring
                them where possible.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="tab"></span>An important goal in 2021 is for the world to agree on a new biodiversity framework at the 15th meeting of the Conference of Parties to the CBD in Kunming, China. Throughout 2020, UNEP advocates an ambitious and
                measurable framework that supports more, larger and better managed protected areas, agriculture and fisheries that actively promote biodiversity, an end to harmful subsidies, and a shift from destructive extraction resource to sustainable
                consumption and production patterns.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>Things you can do to protect biodiversity<br></h2>
            <h3><br> 1. Support local farms.
            </h3><br>
            <p>
                <span class="tab"></span>Regularly buying from small local farmers at stands or markets helps to keep dollars in the local economy and supports agricultural efforts to conserve biodiversity. When at markets, it is important to know the
                lingo—’organic’ is ideal for you and for the planet, but farmers who practice ‘Integrated Pest Management’ can offer high quality products with nearly no chemical intervention. Community Supported Agriculture is another great way to eat
                in-season fresh, local food while also financially supporting local farmers. <br><br>
            </p>

            <h3><br> 2. Save the bees!
            </h3><br>
            <p>
                <span class="tab"></span>Bees are important to preserving biodiversity – and they are increasingly under attack from varroa mites. You can help save them by planting nectar-producing wildflowers in your backyard, or even building bee boxes
                for local bees to call home. When embarking on DIY home projects, be mindful about the products you use, as standard backyard pesticides can be harmful or deadly to bees. <br><br>
            </p>

            <h3><br> 3. Plant local flowers, fruits and vegetables.
            </h3><br>
            <p>
                <span class="tab"></span>Research the flora, fruits and veggies native to your area, and plant a variety in your backyard or a hanging garden. To aid in this effort, support local nurseries that specialize in native species. Nurseries
                can be great sources of information about plant maintenance and care. They should also be able to tell you where they source their plants from—the more local, the better. By supporting local wildlife, you’re helping to preserve the biodiversity
                of your area and support its local ecosystem.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h3><br> 4. Take shorter showers!
            </h3><br>
            <p>
                <span class="tab"></span>Biodiversity depends on the abundance of local fresh water. Taking five-minute showers and turning the water off while washing your hands, doing the dishes, or brushing your teeth are all easy ways to conserve
                water.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3><br> 5. Respect local habitats..
            </h3><br>
            <p>
                <span class="tab"></span>Check the products you buy and the companies you support to ensure that your buying habits are not contributing to destruction of habitat elsewhere. Look for labels such as FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) or Rainforest
                Alliance Certified. Both organizations are committed not only to the conservation of the Earth’s resources, but also to advocating for the human rights of the native peoples who inhabit the land many products are sourced from. <br><br>
