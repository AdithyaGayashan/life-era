        <p><span class="tab"></span> End desertification and restore degraded land Deforestation, climate change, and human activities such as incorrect link to video planting 500 plants per hour using a rewilding stickland management have expedited the
            progress of desertification in many locations.
        </p>


        <p><span class="tab"></span> There is a loss of biodiversity and potential food production capability when land loses its capacity for biological productivity. Not only are local animal species endangered, but human life is also under jeopardy. The
            threat to human existence could start with a disruption in the food supply and the resulting economic damage. This could eventually result in the utter collapse of any human settlements in the area, and also poverty in the neighboring areas.
        </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span> Cause- Key problem is that when biological productivity is consumed in an unsustainable manner, not only are local plant species greatly reduced or lost, but also the animals that helped to maintain that local ecology
            are lost. Animals aid in the spread of plant seeds through their normal activities such as feeding, foraging, burrowing, and so on. As those animals are lost to an area, there is no replacement of the local plant species, so only old specimens
            are left until even those die off, leaving only barren land or a desert.
        </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span> Preventive measures include:
        </p>
        <p>Bringing land and water management together to protect soils from erosion, salinization, and other forms of degradation.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span> Protecting the vegetative cover, which can be a powerful tool for soil conservation by preventing wind and water erosion.
        </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span> Integrating land use for grazing and farming where conditions are favorable, allowing for more efficient nutrient cycling within agricultural systems. Using a mix of traditional practices and locally acceptable and adapted
            land use technologies.
        </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span> Giving local communities the ability to prevent desertification and effectively manage dryland resources. Turning to alternative livelihoods that do not rely on traditional land uses, such as dryland aquaculture, greenhouse
            agriculture, and tourism-related activities, is less taxing on local land and natural resources while still providing long-term sustainability.
