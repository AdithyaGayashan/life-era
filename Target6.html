                <h3>Objective</h3><br>
                <span class="tab"></span>The objective of this Protocol is the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, including by appropriate access to genetic resources and by appropriate transfer
                of relevant technologies, taking into account all rights over those resources and to technologies, and by appropriate funding, thereby contributing to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components.
                <br><br>
            </p>


            <p>
                <h3>ACCESS TO GENETIC RESOURCES</h3><br>
                <span class="tab"></span> 1. In the exercise of sovereign rights over natural resources, and subject to domestic access and benefit-sharing legislation or regulatory requirements, access to genetic resources for their utilization shall
                be subject to the prior informed consent of the Party providing such resources that is the country of origin of such resources or a Party that has acquired the genetic resources in accordance with the Convention, unless otherwise determined
                by that Party.<br> <br>2. In accordance with domestic law, each Party shall take measures, as appropriate, with the aim of ensuring that the prior informed consent or approval and involvement of indigenous and local communities is obtained
                for access to genetic resources where they have the established right to grant access to such resources.<br><br> 3. Pursuant to paragraph 1 above, each Party requiring prior informed consent shall take the necessary legislative, administrative
                or policy measures, as appropriate, to:<br><br> (a) Provide for legal certainty, clarity and transparency of their domestic access and benefit-sharing legislation or regulatory requirements<br> (b) Provide for fair and non-arbitrary rules
                and procedures on accessing genetic resources<br> (c) Provide information on how to apply for prior informed consent<br> (d) Provide for a clear and transparent written decision by a competent national authority, in a cost-effective manner
                and within a reasonable period of time <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3><br>
                <span class="tab"></span>In the development and implementation of its access and benefit-sharing legislation or regulatory requirements, each Party shall:<br><br> (a) Create conditions to promote and encourage research which contributes
                to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, particularly in developing countries, including through simplified measures on access for non-commercial research purposes, taking into account the need to address a change
                of intent for such research;<br> <br>(b) Pay due regard to cases of present or imminent emergencies that threaten or damage human, animal or plant health, as determined nationally or internationally. Parties may take into consideration
                the need for expeditious access to genetic resources and expeditious fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of such genetic resources, including access to affordable treatments by those in need, especially in developing
                countries;
                <br> <br>(c) Consider the importance of genetic resources for food and agriculture and their special role for food security. <br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h3>TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE ASSOCIATED WITH GENETIC RESOURCES</h3><br>
                <span class="tab"></span> 1. In implementing their obligations under this Protocol, Parties shall in accordance with domestic law take into consideration indigenous and local communities customary laws, community protocols and procedures,
                as applicable, with respect to traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources.<br><br> 2. Parties, with the effective participation of the indigenous and local communities concerned, shall establish mechanisms to inform potential
                users of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources about their obligations, including measures as made available through the Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House for access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits
                arising from the utilization of such knowledge.<br><br> 3. Parties shall endeavour to support, as appropriate, the development by indigenous and local communities, including women within these communities, of:<br> <br> (a) Community protocols
                in relation to access to traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of such knowledge;<br> (b) Minimum requirements for mutually agreed terms to
                secure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources; and<br> (c) Model contractual clauses for benefit-sharing arising from the utilization of traditional
                knowledge associated with genetic resources.<br><br> 4. Parties, in their implementation of this Protocol, shall, as far as possible, not restrict the customary use and exchange of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge
                within and amongst indigenous and local communities in accordance with the objectives of the Convention. <br><br>
