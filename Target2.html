 <h1>End Deforestation and Restore Degraded Forests</h1>
 <p>

    Deforestation and forest degradation are the biggest threats to forests worldwide.
    Over half of the tropical forests worldwide have been destroyed since the 1960s, and every second, more than one hectare of tropical forests is destroyed or drastically degraded.<br><br>
    The degradation and loss of forests threatens the survival of many species, and reduces the ability of forests to provide essential services.<br><br>
    Deforestation and forest degradation impact the lives of 1.6 billion people whose livelihoods depend on forests. One billion of them are among the worldâ€™s poorest.<br><br>
    Nature-based Solutions such as forest landscape restoration (FLR) can reverse the effects of deforestation and degradation and regain the ecological, social, climatic and economic benefits of forests.
