    <p2 id="Top">What is the issue? </p2>
    
<p3>
        Deforestation and forest degradation are the biggest threats to forests worldwide. Deforestation occurs when forests<br> are converted to non-forest uses, such as agriculture and road construction. Forest degradation occurs when forest ecosystems<br>lose their capacity to provide important goods and services to people and nature.<br><br>
        
        Over half of the tropical forests worldwide have been destroyed since the 1960s, and every second, more than one hectare of <br> tropical forests is destroyed or drastically degraded. This intense and devastating pressure on forests is not limited to <br> the tropics an estimated 3.7 million hectares of Europe’s forests are damaged by livestock, insects, diseases, forest fires, and<br> other human-linked activities.<br>
</p3>

<p4 id="Middle">Why is it important?</p4>
<p5><b>Biodiversity</b><br><br><br>

    Over 80% of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity can be found in forests from pine trees in the boreal North to the rainforests in the tropics. <br>The degradation and loss of forests threaten the survival of many species, and reduce the ability of forests to provide essential services<br> such as clean air and water, healthy soils for agriculture, and climate regulation.<br><br>
    
   <b>Sustainable livelihoods </b>
    <br><br><br>
    
    Healthy forests support the livelihoods of 1.6 billion people globally, one billion of whom are among the world’s poorest.<br> Deforestation and forest degradation have real and tangible impacts on the lives of these vulnerable communities. For example, 52 per cent of<br> all land used for food production is moderately or severely impacted by the erosion of healthy soil. This occurs when trees are removed from a landscape,<br>leading to increased food insecurity.<br><br>
    
   <b> Climate mitigation and adaptation</b><br><br><br>
    
    The world’s forests absorb 2.4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, one-third of the annual CO2 released from<br> burning fossil fuels. Forest destruction emits further carbon into the atmosphere, with 4.3–5.5 GtCO2eq/yr generated annually, largely from <br>deforestation and forest degradation. Protecting and restoring this vast carbon sink is essential for mitigating climate change.<br><br>
    
    Forests also play a crucial role in climate change adaptation efforts. They act as a food safety net during climate shocks, <br>reduce risks from disasters like coastal flooding, and help regulate water flows and microclimates. Improving the health of these forest ecosystems<br> and introducing sustainable management practices increase the resilience of human and natural systems to the impacts of climate change.

    <p6 id="Bottom">What can be done?</p6>
    <p7>
        <b>Forest landscape restoration (FLR)</b><br><br><br>

Nature-based Solutions such as forest landscape restoration can help countries reverse the effects of deforestation and degradation and<br> regain the ecological, social, climatic and economic benefits of forests.<br><br>

FLR brings people together to identify and implement the most appropriate restoration interventions in a landscape. It seeks to accommodate<br> the needs of all land users and multiple land uses.<br><br>

FLR is not just about planting trees it can include multiple activities like agroforestry, erosion control and natural forest regeneration.<br>
 FLR also addresses the underlying drivers of forest loss. For example, it provides farming communities living in and around forests with knowledge<br> on sustainable agricultural methods that do not rely on destroying forests.<br><br>
