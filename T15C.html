            <h3>The challenge and the opportunity</h3><br>
            <span class="tab"></span>Due to rising environmental awareness, international conventions and globalisation of markets, most countries now want to manage their forests more sustainably than they have in the past. However, progress is hindered
            by a lack of suitable financing. Many countries currently take an ad-hoc approach to financing, using a small number of mechanisms such as grants and subsidies, that often cover only a few activities. Furthermore, reliance on government budgets
            and overseas development assistance as funding sources remains high. To address this challenge, it is necessary to examine how to expand and diversify financing mechanisms and sources of finance. At the same time, the contributions of forests
            to economic development, human well-being and the environment are increasingly recognised as important. This opportunity has been seized by some countries that are now experimenting with innovative financing mechanisms. These mechanisms may
            generate new sources of revenue and help to make investments in sustainable forest management more attractive and feasible.

        <p>
            <h3>Constraints to implementation</h3><br>
            <span class="tab"></span>There are numerous constraints that limit the financing of sustainable forest management. The most important is that many of the benefits of sustainable forest management do not generate revenue for forest owners and
            managers. Therefore, they have no incentive to produce the full range of benefits from forests and continue to focus on production of timber and a few other marketed products. A second constraint is the complexity and generally higher costs
            and perceived risks of sustainable forest management compared to other land uses, including unsustainable forest practices. These economic constraints are often compounded by policy, legal and institutional constraints such as: weak institutions,
            a lack of policy co-ordination across sectors; unresolved land tenure issues; and weak governance, as well as a lack of technical capacity in countries.
