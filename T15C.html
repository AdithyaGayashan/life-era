            Consumer demand and transnational organized criminal networks are driving the illicit trade of wildlife and wildlife products. The illegal trade has evolved into one of the world's largest black markets and is valued at tens of billions of dollars. A
            broad development issue, wildlife crime threatens wildlife populations, wildlife-friendly livelihoods such as ecotourism, and community lands. The activities of criminal networks fuel global corruption and harm local communities and the ecosystems
            where they live. Criminals use people and wildlife for their own ends by pressuring people with few economic options into poaching, corrupting those that help transport illicit goods, and selling luxury items to consumers who may or may not
            understand the true cost of their consumption choices.</p>


        <p>
            To address wildlife trafficking, the Agency works in priority countries that are sources of wildlife and wildlife products, transit points, and/or destinations for sellers and buyers. To support the enforcement of wildlife trade laws, USAID builds the
            capacities of rangers and scouts, forensic scientists, legislators, prosecutors, and judges to detect, arrest, investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate wildlife traffickers along this illegal supply chain. USAID also fosters the ability of community
            scouts to manage and protect wildlife as part of community-based conservation programs.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>USAID’s comprehensive approach to addressing wildlife crime helps law enforcement staff and affected communities to reduce demand for wildlife products and interrupt the flow of illegal products. With this support, USAID’s partner countries can
            better fight the criminal networks that undermine development efforts, thereby better conserving their wildlife for future generations.

        <h3>Poaching crisis</h3>

        <p>
            Illegal wildlife trade has long posed a genuine threat to biodiversity, including not only iconic animals such as elephants, rhinos, tigers and pangolins but also other less prominent species such as saiga, helmeted hornbills, geckos and rosewoods.
        </p>
        <p>Recently, however, the exponential increase in demand for products such as ivory, rhino horn and tiger parts has created a market lucrative enough to attract international criminal networks. This has resulted in a wholesale assault on the world’s
            wildlife, which is decimating global biodiversity, threatening many species with extinction and plundering valuable natural assets that are ultimately worth more alive than dead, particularly to those who rely on natural resources for their
            very livelihood.</p>

        <p>The potentially devastating effects of this unsustainable trade have begun to hit the headlines, focusing global attention on an issue that has been high on the agenda of Fauna & Flora International (FFI) since the 1970s, when we were instrumental
            in establishing TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network.</p>
